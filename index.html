<div id="details">

Let's see here. While charm traditions may vary wildly or mildly across the planets, we've got some consistencies. (If you haven't read the basic information on leprechaun romance, see the<a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=008316">canon info here.</a> If you have, continue.)

<br><br> All charms are considered 'romantic', in the sense that all of them are forms of committed relationships, where 'platonic' is a word which effectively means 'non-romantic', i.e. a relationship with no specific expectations or commitment beyond regular friendship. No particular charm, perhaps excepting hearts, <i>has</i> to involve traditional romantic intimacy. (Kissing, reproduction, etc.) They may, but that's up to the pair, as opposed to a standard expectation.

<br><br>Having more than one partner in the same charm or charm combination may or may not be standard, depending on the planet, however the definitions are as such: Polyamory (highly normalized, no matter where you're from) is having more than one partner in a charm (or rarely charm combination). Monogamy is either having only one partner per charm, or having one partner per charm combination, depending on the planet. If you really need to distinguish them, we could say 'charm-poly'/'trove-poly' or something.

<br><br>The following will detail the timeline headcanons for each charm. All charms can be combined with each other and are generally expected to. Clover's explanation is provided in order to give a basic leprechaun POV.

"One of the charms is characterized 8y romantic love, as understood 8y 8oth trolls and humans. 8ut after that, all 8ets are off."
<br>Hearts is more or less the 'equivalent' to flushed attraction, although there's so many definitions for what that actually <i>is</i> for humans and carapaces there's a mixed bag of understanding. 
<br><br><center><b>Flirting</b></center>
<br>i mean just watch any romcom idk
<br><center><b>Other</b></center> 
<br>Leprechaun hearts are pink, therefore, someone with a crush in this charm may be called "turning pink" or similar, and the idiom "in the pink" means something different to them.
<br><br><center><b>Leprechaun POV</b></center> 
<br>it's....confusin', but. for me, when i'm in hearts with someone, it means...i wanna do everythin' for 'em. i want to be soft for them, and sweet, and all that sappy gushy stuff. i want to be someone that makes 'em feel warm.

<div id="details">
To apply a moon charm to a relationship is to say that the feelings involved in it are ever-shifting back and forth; essentially, a regularly vacillating relationship. What it vacillates to and from is entirely dependant on the feelings of the leprechauns involved, and any other charms in the trove. Moons may also be applied if, rather than vacillation, one or more partners has directly mixed feelings; it may be used to organize what the partner desires to express. (See: Karkat's fuckign quadrangle)
<br><br><center><b>Flirting</b></center>Direct, traditional moons flirting is uncommon, due to vacillating feelings not always being clear initially. However, if flirting in either expression of this charm, leprechauns may often pose challenges ("mutual chicanery, such as the exchange of pranks, coy riddles, slapstick shenanigans, and games of chance") or gifts with inherently dual natures.
<br><center><b>Other</b></center> 
Given the two extremes are defined by the pair, leprechauns may refer to themselves as "waxing" "waning" "new" or "full" depending on their current feelings. However, in some expressions, "new" may in fact mean a lack of current romantic feeling at all, waiting for it to return to passionate "full." 
<br><br><center><b>Leprechaun POV</b></center>
moons's for when your feelings for someone change back an' forth, like phases. you'd call it vacillation, prob'ly, 'cept i haven't heard lots o' people say that word like it's not a <i>bad</i> thing. 
an' it's also used for if someone only has feelings sometimes 'n not others.
it's pretty normal for us, i don't see how a lot o' relationships would work out 's well as they do without thinkin' o' moons.

</div>
<div id="details">A stars charm may be found unreciprocated, however many leprechauns found the target of it choose to accept it into a defined relationship regardless. It is based on a very strong admiration for the partner, most often based on their personal qualities or mutual skills.  Stars crushes may occasionally take the form of desiring strong approval from the target rather than directing it,  but most frequently involve both. "Starstruck" leprechauns commonly exhibit a sustained "honeymoon" phase in which they display a disability to see any flaws in their partner whatsoever; the charm often fails if this cracks. Many healthier stars relationships exist, and are viewed as optimal to more romantically/self-aware leprechauns.

<br><br><center><b>Flirting</b></center>Basically, fawning.  A lot of fawning. Actively visible efforts to show off/impress are also somewhat common in this charm, which occasionally leads to leprechauns confused with whether one is a natural  braggart or flirting.
<br><center><b>Other</b></center> 
<a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/69/23/5b/69235b9fc94c1cf559e2079553e6090b.jpg ">Also see this.</a>
<br><br><center><b>Leprechaun POV</b></center>
stars are sort o' like sayin' you feel like it's a big honor t' be around 'em. pride, admiration, fascination, that sort of stuff. folks end up talkin' up their crush pretty often, or tryin' to impress them a lot, usually. think "starstruck!"
</div>

</div>
<div id="details">Describable as "wildcard," clovers is an unstable charm, defined by lack of definition. This often occurs when a leprechaun experiences desire for another but in a way they're unsure of or cannot describe. Anything goes, depending on the push and pull of whatever the partners desire, often with little thought given to any expectations. There is a notable risk involved when pursuing this charm on its own, as communication isn't always frequent.
<br><br><center><b>Flirting</b></center> This is completely case-by-case! One might just go up to their crush and state outright they'd like to clovers it up, one might simply start the usual jig, one might do all manner of things until the crush catches on.
<br><br><center><b>Leprechaun POV</b></center>
clovers, (you have no idea how many jokes i put up with,) is more of a wildcard than anythin'. we usually say we're clovers for folks when we know we're feelin' somethin', but we don't got words for it. it's good for, you know, not getting all in a tizzy about boxes that don't fit.

</div>
<div id="details">Diamonds are viewed as important. The charm is based on a strong desire to protect or defend the partner, a drive to keep them from coming into any harm before it can happen. This may lead to being somewhat controlling, but most (MOST) leprechauns engaging in it don't have such a problem, and understand what risks are healthy. It's widely considered to be one of the most competitive of the nine charms. Diamonds are based less on trust of an emotional level, and more like the trust you have in a lock working.

<br><br><center><b>Flirting</b></center> 
This is pretty straightforward, I think.
<br><br><center><b>Leprechaun POV</b></center>
diamonds is the protector charm. you often value your diamond's safety more than your own. you are their guard, you are the person who keeps danger from getting anywhere near them. jus' as long as they don't throw themselves in front o' it tryin' to protect you first. :P

</div>
<div id="details">Playful! Horseshoes are based in messing with each other harmlessly. This covers teasing, stupid puns, anything that would go under the umbrella of wanting to mess around with someone, it's probably in horseshoes. It’s adorable.
<br><br><center><b>Flirting</b></center> Horseshoes is pretty easy to initiate with partners already familiar to whoever has such a crush, but otherwise generally small pranks or otherwise japery are set up to understand a courtship attempt.
<br><center><b>Other</b></center> 
This is something seen in many human friendships. Now take that, and take it to eleven. Horseshoes flirting may be referred to as "throwing/tossing horseshoes" or "horsing around".
<br><br><center><b>Leprechaun POV</b></center>
horseshoes is basically just great. it's the charm just for play and fun, jokes and games an' puns and all that stuff. it's laughing and messing around and all that jazz. be silly, be a fuckin' dork if you want, or just fuck around. that doesn’t mean serious-type folks can’t engage in it-- it jus’ means that their horseshoe is the person they trust to act looser around.

</div>
<div id="details">Balloons is an aggressive pursuit. This may involve traps, trickery, manipulation, mild injury, general getting in the way of the partner. This is often driven with a desire to knock them down a notch or four.  It may also be "You have something I want, I have something you want, come and get it," as an effectively issued challenge. In any manner, it's only balloons if reciprocation is desired.

<br><br><center><b>Flirting</b></center> Often some forms of harmless (or less than harmless, depending) antagonism. Posing taunts, challenges, stealing objects of importance, certain forms of posturing, et cetera.
<br><center><b>Other</b></center> 
Trumping (temporarily, hopefully) a partner in this charm is referred to as "being the higher balloon" or "rising higher." Because of balloons' color, red has more of the hostility connotation in leprechaun culture than it  holds in ours. Trolls may see elements of kismesitude in balloons charms, however balloons partners more often than not have no hate for each other.
<br><br><center><b>Leprechaun POV</b></center>
balloons is...it's a pursuit, is what it is! in balloons there's a lot more take than there is give, but it ain't unbalanced, 'cause both partners are s'posed to act like that. it's traps and tricks and wantin' to take someone down a notch, take what you want, even though you like 'em.

</div>
<div id="details">To be rainbows for someone is to be so deeply enamored with them that practically nothing else matters. A leprechaun with a rainbows crush can get hurt and they won't care, they probably WILL get hurt and they won't care, a pair of leprechauns in such a relationship might even hurt each other in some way and they won't care-- nothing matters but staying in contact.  It's an addiction to a person, from a human perspective. A common aspect of a rainbows charm is the ability to be oneself around the partner, fully and entirely, and involves an innate, deep trust with such a thing. 
<br><br><center><b>Flirting</b></center> Rainbows flirting isn't really something done intentionally, not often. This is because a crush developing often goes unrealized for some time by the subject.
<br><center><b>Other</b></center> 
Rainbows easily applies with any other charm set and on its own, as it denotes a strong need to remain communicating near-constantly with a partner and that isn't easily incompatible with anything. Ruby and Sapphire from SU are textbook rainbows, particularly in that one baseball episode.
<br><br><center><b>Leprechaun POV</b></center> 
and rainbows is...it's when something between you is so fantastic, it's like you'd never want to do anything else, like you could live on them alone. it's being perfect by being yourselves. it's like anything you could do would be spectacular, as long as you're doing it with them.

</div>
<div id="details">Pot of gold, the cahoooooooots charm. Basically a relationship based on a certain kind of cooperative 'click', the kind of person that you would claim to be on the same wavelength with. Soulmates can be complete opposites in the way they think, but sometimes you find people just like you.

<br><br><center><b>Flirting</b></center>
Po'g flirting is generally done by frequent invitations to create, lead, or otherwise work together. A prank/shenanigan which involves a po'g charm might involve a setup in which the culprit knows the victim is going to figure it out due to their similar thinking.

<br><br><center><b>Leprechaun POV</b></center>pot o' gold, or po'g, is for when you match right up to someone in anythin' you wanna do. it's conspiration, it's a team, it's somebody you can get everything done with faster an' better than anybody else. it's hard to find, for most, th' kind of guy you can plan anythin' with without clashin'.
